# Lake Macquarie Premier League

## Welcome to the Lake Macquarie Premier League App

### Introduction

The Lake Macquarie Premier League App is designed to be used by an administrator of an amateur Football (Soccer) competition in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia. 

It is designed to efficiently handle data for a 14 Round season among 8 local teams. Each team plays the 7 other teams in the competition twice per year, once at their home ground, and once as the away team at their opponents home ground, for a total of 56 games, played from November 2023 to March 2024.

The goal was to make the data for the entire season easy to store, and retrieve at a moments notice, based on a few predicted user stories:
* The administrator who wants to be able to store results in a simple CSV that could then be used to feed an Excel Spreadsheet.
* The fan, who wants to how many teams are in the competition and who they are. They will also be able to look up the games occurring in the coming week, or many weeks into the future. The may also want to check games that have already happened.
* The player, who wants to be able to plan their life around the games and wants to access easily where they'll be playing for the whole season in advance, and also look back at where they played.
* Any of the above users who want to be able to view a running tally of results of the games throughout the season. 


To meet all of these user stories, I decided that their would need to be 8 features in total:
1. Teams Competing 
2. Games this week
3. Display Rounds
4. Display the Draw for a particular team
5. Enter Results of a game
6. Delete Results of a game
7. View the current results in a table
